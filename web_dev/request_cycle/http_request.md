What are some common HTTP status codes?
> the ones I saw before are: 
404 Not Found
403 Forbidden
502 Bad Gateway
But it is good to know that groups are:
1xx Informational responses
2xx Success
3xx Redirection
4xx Client errors
5xx Server error


What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
GET method request a representation of specified resource and should only retrieve data
with POST method we are sending info in order to store it on the server

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
cookie is a small files that are stored on clients PC by browser from the web sites clients are visiting.
